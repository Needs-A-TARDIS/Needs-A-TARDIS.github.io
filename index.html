		Hi there! I'm a rising senior studying electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. I believe in the power of storytelling - whether through short fiction or video games - to teach, to build communities, and to transform lives.
		I've taken a handful of computer science classes and aim to teach myself even more, and I'm minoring in creative writing.
